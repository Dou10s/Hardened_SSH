# assume the attacker has already compromised the remote host and elevated privileges

BASE SYSTEM (Linux-Base)
___________________________________________________________________________________
as larry:
1. eval `ssh-agent` 
2. ssh-add ./.ssh/id_rsa
the agent now has access to the key, it creates a tmp file that is a socket to the agent
3. ssh -A -J Linux-Base-Jump.sshlab Linux-Base-Server.sshlab
this will forward the agent with the ssh connection to the remote computer, going through the jump server first

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
JUMP SYSTEM (Linux-Base-Jump)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
as ansible su to root:
1. ls /tmp | grep ssh

Notice that an elevated attacker on a jump host does not have access to the keys even when the agent is forwarded 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SERVER SYSTEM (Linux-Base-Server)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
as ansible su to root:
1. ls /tmp | grep ssh
# The agent has been forwarded to the final destination
2. export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-XXXXXXXXX/agent.YYY (replace the X and Y with the actual numbers)
3. ssh larry@Linux-Base-Server.sshlab -v

Notice that an elevated attacker on the final host in a proxyjump configuration still has access to any machines the user's key can authenticate to because the user forwarded the agent.

HARDENED SYSTEM

*this test is the same on the hardened system as test 3, the forwarded agent still requires unlocking the Yubikey with pin and touch.
