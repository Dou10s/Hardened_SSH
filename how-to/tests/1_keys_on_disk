BASE SYSTEM

read user key
1. cat /home/larry/.ssh/id_rsa   # the key should exist 
    A. if the key is NOT password protected, then the private key is exposed and can be used by the attacker
    B. if the key is password protected (ends in ==) then the key can be copied off the system for the password to be cracked OR a keylogger can be used to capture the password for the key

attack succeeds

HARDENED SYSTEM

read user key
1. cat /home/larry/.ssh/*   # there should NOT be a key here (it is stored on the YUBIKEY)
    A. The private key would need to be extracted from the YUBIKEY
    B. The private key would need to be compromised from whatever machine created the key if that machine kept a local copy (hopefully secure)

attack fails
